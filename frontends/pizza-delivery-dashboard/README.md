# üçï Pizza Delivery Dashboard

`pizza-delivery-dashboard` is a lightweight Go web server that provides 
a simple dashboard for managing pizza delivery workflows using [Temporal](https://temporal.io/). 

It allows you to view workflows waiting for a driver and assign 
available drivers directly from the web interface.

## Features

- Displays a list of workflows where a driver has not yet been assigned.
- Allows assignment of drivers to workflows via a simple HTML dashboard.
- Integrates with Temporal's workflow service for querying and signaling workflows.
- Lightweight, minimal UI using [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+  
- Temporal server running (default namespace: `default`)  

### Usage

Once the server is running, open your browser: <http://localhost:8234>

You will see a list of workflows waiting for drivers. 
Each workflow can be assigned a driver from a dropdown menu. 
After assignment, the workflow is signaled, and the dashboard reloads.

### Configurable Drivers

The server comes with a default set of drivers:

```go
var drivers = []Driver{
	{Emoji: "üßí", Name: "Tommy Brown"},
	{Emoji: "üë¥", Name: "Walter Smith"},
	{Emoji: "üßî", Name: "James O'Connor"},
}
```

You can modify this list in `main.go` to match your drivers.

### Endpoints

| Endpoint                  | Method | Description |
|---------------------------|--------|-------------|
| `/`                       | GET    | Renders the dashboard, showing the number of unassigned orders. |
| `/assign`                 | POST   | Assigns a driver to a workflow and signals the workflow in Temporal. Accepts `workflowID`, `runID`, `driver`, and optional `note` form values. |
| `/style.css`              | GET    | Serves the CSS for the dashboard. |
| `/orders`                 | GET    | Returns the HTML fragment containing the list of unassigned orders and driver assignment forms. |
| `/orders/count.stream`    | GET    | Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream emitting the current count of unassigned orders whenever it changes. |

## How It Works

1. The server queries Temporal for workflows where `WorkflowType="PlaceOrder" AND ExecutionStatus="Running" AND DriverAssigned=false`
2. The dashboard displays the list of workflows and available drivers.
3. When a driver is assigned, the server signals the workflow using Temporal's `SignalWorkflow` API.
4. The dashboard reloads to reflect updated workflow statuses.
